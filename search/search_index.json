After the account is approved you will receive credentials via e-mail from the it @ cent.uw.edu.pl address. The obtained password will allow you to login to the entry node (jumphost-59) at sih-59.cent.uw.edu.pl and from there to login to the CHEMBIO cluster front-node (ssh CHEMBIO) and use the compute nodes ogr-[0-1] and troll-[1] . Please familiarize yourself with the general rules of cluster usage before proceeding further - LINK Warning Important: in case of lost password or other technical difficulties related to the entry node (not cluster front node or compute nodes) please reach out to the IT department at CeNT UW - address: it @ cent.uw.edu.pl . Include the [sih-59] prefix in the message title and add cluster administrators @Maciek and @Pawel in CC. Information Please note that password changes on each of the compute nodes and the entry node are synced. It is advised to change your initially obtained password after first login. Connecting via SSH Connections to the CHEMBIO cluster are handled via SSH protocol. See the figure below for a brief introduction of the network organization: In order to login to the entry node you can issue the following command: ssh your_username@sih-59.cent.uw.edu.pl This will bring you to the entry node (jumphost-59) , afterwards you can connect to the CHEMBIO (10.10.59.30) front node and submit tasks to the compute nodes ( click here for a complete list of available resources), for example: ssh your_username@10.10.59.30 In order to simplify file copying and every day work the suggested way of connecting to the CHEMBIO cluster is to use sshuttle . This allows to bypass the login node and work almost the same way as being connected via VPN to the local network. Example Assuming sshuttle was installed according to the guide you can connect as follows: sshuttle --dns -NHr your_username@sih-59.cent.uw.edu.pl 10 .10.59.1/24 Once connection is established you can directly login to the CHEMBIO front node or compute nodes using: ssh your_username@CHEMBIO.sih-59.internal Information Additionally, depending on your computer and network settings, you may have to connect to CHEMBIO nodes once without sshuttle so that SSH connections are properly configured. To avoid putting password during each login you can set up authorization via a certificate - additional information is available here Work environment Each user has access a personal directory and can use the shared workspace: /home/users/your_username /workspace Warning These folders are shared between all nodes of the CHEMBIO cluster as well as the jumphost-59. Transferring files The recommended options to send or fetch files from CHEMBIO cluster are either scp or rsync . Next steps Once the basics are set up you should be able to start running calculations.

You can either start an interactive session using srun or allocate resources using the salloc utility and then ssh into that host and work there. You can tweak your allocation depending on work needs, see the following table for details and examples. Both commands have a similar set of options: Argument Description -n Number of cores used allocated for the job ( default = 1, max = 36 ) --gres Number of GPUs allocated for the job (_default = None, --gres=gpu, --gres=gpu:2) --mem Amount of memory (in GBs) per allocated core allocated for the job ( default = 1, max = 60 ) -w Specify host or hosts to get your resources (i.e. troll-1) Example To login interactively to cn002 with 8 cores and a total of 12 GB of memory : srun -n 8 -w cn002 --mem = 12 --pty bash To obtain an allocation on cn002 with 8 cores and a total of 12 GB of memory : salloc -n 8 -w cn002 --mem = 12 Important!
